      <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
      <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>The site will contain an overview of the Edusketch app, which is a collaborative writing tool that will be designed for remote collaborative learning. Core content will describe its features, such as a shared digital whiteboard, vanishing highlight tools, and a simple interface. The site may also include a forum where users can post discussions, ask questions, or share tips. There may also be a directory page for connecting with tutors who use Edusketch, helping students find support and educators expand their reach.</p>
      <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
      <p>All written content will be created from scratch, based on the projects goals and functionality, which may change over time. I envision images to include mockups of the user interface or screenshots of early versions of an Edusketch prototype, but may be too advanced. Images may include public domain images of chalk boards or white boards. Any additional icons or visual assets may be sourced from free to use repositories with proper attribution if required.</p>
      <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
      <p>This is the age of online learning. I think students and teachers may often struggle to collaborate and study effectively over traditional vvideo calls. I envision Edusketch to offer a real-time shared canvas that would make remote education or collaborative studying more interactive and visual, which would be especially useful for subjects like math, science or art. Users should care because a tool like this would solve a common problem in a simple, highly accessible way.</p>
      <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
      <p>A dedicated website could provide a central hub where users could discover and learn what Edusketch is, how it works, and possibly how to access or use it. It would give the project legitimacy, offer documentation or patch notes, and may even allow for future expansion with tech support, user onboarding or even hosting the app directly through the browser itself. I think it is essential for outreach to students, tutors and educators who are looking for better remote learning tools.</p>
      <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
      <p>Ideally, I would like them to explore the site to learn more about Edusketch, view its features, maybe try a free demo version or sign up for early access. There may also be a section where they could submit feedback, ask questions, or download the app sometime in the future. For now, I think my goal would be for users to understand the tool and get excited about what it can offer.</p>
      <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
      <p>My primary goal for the site would be to introduce Edusketch to potential users and build awareness around its purpose and value. It can serve as a launchpad for the app b y clearly communicating its features, use cases and future plans. Over time, the site itself may evolve into a support portal, user community, or landing page for educators looking to adopt the tool in their teaching.</p>
