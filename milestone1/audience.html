      <h2>The Audience</h2>
      <h4>Primary Users</h4>
      <p>The primary users of Edusketch are students and educators engaged in remote or hybrid learning, or study groups that simply need a more effective collaborative tool. It's especially suited for situations where visual explanation is the key, such as math, science, or technical tutoring.
      <h4>Geolocation</h4>
      <p>Edusketch will primarily serve users in North America, particularly the United States and Canada, where online education has become increasingly common. However, it is designed to be lightweight and accessible globally, including areas with limited internet bandwidth.</p>
      <h4>Age</h4>
      <p>The app is targeted at students of all ages. Though I expect the primary audience to include middle and high school students, college undergrads, and even tutors or TAs who assist with coursework.
      <h4>Other Demographics</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Education Level</li>
          <li>Tech-Savviness</li>
          <li>Occupation</li>
          <li>Device Usage</li>
        </ul>
        Users these days typically have a moderate to high comfort level with digital tools, though Edusketch will be designed to be intuitive even for far less tech-savvy users. Most access will come from laptops or tablets. I expect many users will be full-time students, part-time tutors, or homeschooling parents seeking a better way to engage learners visually.
